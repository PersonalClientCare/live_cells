This package provides the core definitions of the **Live Cells** library, without the UI 
related functionality. Visit the mother package
[live_cells](https://pub.dev/packages/live_cells) for documentation and examples
of the **Live Cells** library.

*For the time being this package depends on Flutter. In a future release the dependency will be
removed so that the package can be used in dart code without Flutter.*.
