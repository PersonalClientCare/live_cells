# Live Cells

Live Cells is a reactive programming library for Dart, intended to be
used with Flutter. Specifically Live Cells provides a replacement (the
cell) for `ChangeNotifier` and `ValueNotifier` that is simpler to use
and more flexible.

---

## Features

Cells offer the following benefits over `ChangeNotifier` / `ValueNotifier`:

+ Implementing a cell which is an expression of other cells, e.g. `a + b`,
  can be done in a functional manner without manually adding and removing listeners.
+ Simpler resource management, no need to call `dispose`.
+ Integrated with a library of widgets which allow their properties to
  be controlled and observed by cells. This allows for a style of
  programming which fits in with the reactive paradigm of Flutter.
  
This library also has the following advantages over other similar libraries:

+ Supports two-way data flow, whereas most other libraries, if not all, only support
  one-way data flow.
+ Cells are designed to be unobtrusive and indistinguishable, as much
  as is possible, from the values they hold.
+ Live Cells is unopinionated. You're not forced to change the way you
  write your apps. Use as much of its functionality as you need.
+ Integrated with a library of widgets which allow for effortless data
  binding between UI elements and cells.

## Examples

Defining your cells:

<CodeGroup title="Defining cells">
```dart
// Define your cells
final a = MutableCell(0);
final b = MutableCell(1);

// Define a computed cell
//
// The value is recomputed whenever either
// a or b change.
final sum = a + b;

// A more complex computed cell
final computed = ValueCell.computed(() => sqrt(a() * a() + b() * b()));
```
</CodeGroup>

Observe the cells:

<CodeGroup title="Observing cells">
```dart
// This function is called whenever a, b or sum change
ValueCell.watch(() {
	print('${a()} + ${b()} = ${sum()}');
});
```
</CodeGroup>

Display the values of cells in widgets:

<CodeGroup title="Cells in widgets">
```dart
// This widget is rebuilt whenever a, b or sum change
CellWidget.builder(() => Text('${a()} + ${b()} = ${sum()}'));
```
</CodeGroup>

Bind cells directly to widget properties, using the widgets provided
by this library:

<CodeGroup title="Binding to widget properties">
```dart
// The following binds the content of a TextField
// to a cell.
//
// Whenever the value of the cell changes,
// the content is updated to reflect the change.
// Whenever the content of the field changes, the value
// of the cell is updated.
CellTextField(
	// This is also an example of two-way data flow.
	//
	// mutableString() converts the number held in `a` to
	// a string and forwards it to the content of the field.
	//
	// Similarly, mutableString() also converts the string
	// content of the field to a number and forwards it to
	// `a`.
	content: a.mutableString()
);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Getting Started

To start using Live Cells run: `flutter pub add live_cells`, or add the
following to your `pubspec.yaml`:

<CodeGroup title="pubspec.yaml">
```dart
dependencies:
	live_cells: ^0.11.0
```
</CodeGroup>

Now your project is set up to use Live Cells. Follow the remainder of
the documentation for an introduction on how to use the library and an
outline of its features.
