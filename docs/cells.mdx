# Cells

A cell, denoted by the base type `ValueCell`, is an object with a
value and a set of observers that react to changes in its value,
you'll see exactly what that means in a moment.

<CodeGroup title="Creating cells">
```dart
final a = 1.cell;
final b = 'hello world'.cell;
final c = ValueCell.value(someValue);
```
</CodeGroup>

The above is an example of *constant cells*, which can be created
either using the `.cell` property, which is added to the value types
built into Dart, or the `ValueCell.value` constructor which takes a
value and wraps it in a `ValueCell`. A constant cell has a value that
does not change throughout its lifetime. 

The value of any cell is accessed using the `value` property.

<CodeGroup title="Accessing cell values">
```dart
print(a.value); // Prints: 1
print(b.value); // Prints: 'hello world'
print(c.value); // Prints the value of `someValue`
```
</CodeGroup>

## Mutable Cells

Mutable cells, created with the `MutableCell` constructor, hold a
value that can be set directly.

<CodeGroup title="Creating mutable cells">
```dart
final a = MutableCell(0);

print(a.value); // Prints: 0

a.value = 3;
print(a.value); // Prints: 3
```
</CodeGroup>

## Observing Cells

When the value of a cell changes, its observers are notified of the
change. The simplest way to demonstrate this is to set up an *watch
function* using `ValueCell.watch`:

<CodeGroup title="Observing cells">
```dart
final a = MutableCell(0);
final b = MutableCell(1);

final watcher = ValueCell.watch(() {
	print('${a()} + ${b()} = ${a() + b()}');
});

a.value = 5;  // Prints: 5 + 1 = 6
b.value = 10; // Prints: 5 + 10 = 15
```
</CodeGroup>


In the above example a watch function that prints the values of cells
`a` and `b` to the console, along with their sum, is defined. This
function is called automatically when the value of either `a` or `b`
change. **Note**, the value of a cell is referenced using the function
call syntax, within a watch function, rather than accessing he value
property directly.

<info>

When you no longer need the watch function to be called, call `stop`
on the `CellWatcher` object returned by `ValueCell.watch`.

A few things to note from the above example:

1. `ValueCell.watch` registers a watch function which is called
   automatically when the values of the cells referenced within it, in
   this case `a` and `b` change.
   
   In this case the watch function prints the value of `a` and `b` to
   the console.
   
2. The value of a cell is referenced using the function call synt

## Computed Cells

A *computed cell*, defined using `ValueCell.compute`, is a cell of
which the value is a function of the values of one or more argument
cells. Whenever the value of an argument cell changes, the value of
the computed cell is recomputed.

<CodeGroup title="Computed cells">
```dart
final a = MutableCell(1);
final b = MutableCell(2);
final sum = ValueCell.computed(() => a() + b());
```
</CodeGroup>

In the above example, `sum` is a computed cell of which the value is
the sum of cells `a` and `b`. The value of `sum` is recomputed
whenever the values of either `a` or `b` change.

<CodeGroup title="Computed cells">
```dart
final watcher = ValueCell.watch(() {
	print('The sum is ${sum()}');
});

a.value = 3; // Prints: The sum is 5
b.value = 4; // Prints: The sum is 7
```
</CodeGroup>
