# State Restoration

A mobile application may be terminated at any point when the user is
not interacting with it. When it is resumed, due to the user
navigating back to it, it should restore its state to the point where
it was when terminated.

## RestorableCellWidget

`RestorableCellWidget` is like `CellWidget` but also automatically
restores the state of cells, created within its `build` method using
`cell`, when the application is resumed. Therefore all you need to do,
for the most part, to make your widgets restorable is to replace
`CellWidget` with `RestorableCellWidget`.

Here is an example:

<CodeGroup title="RestorableCellWidget example">
```dart
class CellRestorationExample extends RestorableCellWidget {
  @override
  String get restorationId => 'cell_restoration_example';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final sliderValue = cell(() => MutableCell(0.0));
    final switchValue = cell(() => MutableCell(false));
    final checkboxValue = cell(() => MutableCell(true));

    final textValue = cell(() => MutableCell(''));

    return Column(
      children: [
        Text('A Slider'),
        Row(
          children: [
            CellWidget.builder((context) => Text(sliderValue().toStringAsFixed(2))),
            Expanded(
              child: CellSlider(
                 min: 0.0.cell,
                 max: 10.cell,
                 value: sliderValue
              ),
            )
          ],
        ),
        CellSwitchListTile(
          value: switchValue,
          title: Text('A Switch').cell,
        ),
        CellCheckboxListTile(
          value: checkboxValue,
          title: Text('A checkbox').cell,
        ),
        const Text('Enter some text:'),
        CellTextField(content: textValue),
        CellWidget.builder((context) => Text('You wrote: ${textValue()}')),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Notice there is an additional `restorationId` property. When using
`RestorableCellWidget`, you'll need to provide a unique identifier,
via this property, to associate the saved state with the widget. See
[`RestorationMixin.restorationId`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RestorationMixin/restorationId.html),
for more information.

The `build` method defines four widgets, a slider, a switch, a
checkbox and a text field as well as four cells, creating using `cell`
for holding the state of the widgets. The code defining the cells is
exactly the same as it would be with `CellWidget`, however when the
app is resumed the state of the cells, and likewise the widgets which
are dependent on the cells, is restored.

<Info>
* `CellSlider`, `CellSwitchListTile` and `CellCheckboxListTile` are
  the live cell equivalents, provided by `live_cell_widgets`, of
  `Slider`, `SwitchListTile` and `CheckboxListTile` which allow their
  state to be controlled by a `ValueCell`.
* You can use any widgets not just those provided by
  `live_cell_widgets`. The state of the cells defined by
  `RestorableCellWidget.cell` will be restored regardless of the
  widgets you use.
</Info>


In order for cell state restoration to be successful there are some
things you need to take into account:

* Only cells implementing the `RestorableCell` interface can have
  their state restored. All cells provided by **Live Cells** implement
  this interface except:
  + *Lightweight computed cells*, which do not have a state
  + `DelayCell`
* The values of the cells to be restored must be encodable by
  `StandardMessageCodec`. This means that only cells holding primitive
  values (`num`, `bool`, `null`, `String`, `List`, `Map`) can have
  their state saved and restored.
* To support state restoration of cells holding values not supported
  by `StandardMessageCodec`, a `CellValueCoder` has to be provided.

`CellValueCoder` is an interface for encoding (and decoding) a value to a primitive value
representation that is supported by `StandardMessageCodec`. Two methods have to be implemented:

* `encode()` which takes a value and encodes it to a primitive value representation
* `decode()` which decodes a value from its primitive value representation

The following example demonstrates state restoration of a radio button
group using a `CellValueCoder` to encode the *group value* which is an
`enum`.

<CodeGroup title="CellValueCoder example">
```dart
enum RadioValue {
  value1,
  value2,
  value3
}

class RadioValueCoder implements CellValueCoder {
  @override
  RadioValue? decode(Object? primitive) {
    if (primitive != null) {
      final name = primitive as String;
      return RadioValue.values.byName(name);
    }

    return null;
  }

  @override
  Object? encode(covariant RadioValue? value) {
    return value?.name;
  }
}

class CellRestorationExample extends RestorableCellWidget {
  @override
  String get restorationId => 'cell_restoration_example';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final radioValue = cell(
       () => MutableCell<RadioValue?>(RadioValue.value1),
       coder: RadioValueCoder.new
    );

    return Column(
      children: [
        const Text('Radio Buttons:',),
        CellWidget.builder((context) => Text('Selected option: ${radioValue()?.name}')),
        Column(
          children: [
            CellRadioListTile(
              groupValue: radioValue,
              value: RadioValue.value1.cell,
              title: Text('value1').cell,
            ),
            CellRadioListTile(
              groupValue: radioValue,
              value: RadioValue.value2.cell,
              title: Text('value2').cell,
            ),
            CellRadioListTile(
              groupValue: radioValue,
              value: RadioValue.value3.cell,
              title: Text('value3').cell,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

`RadioValueCoder` is a `CellValueCoder` subclass which encodes the
`RadioValue` enum class to a string. In the definition of the
`radioValue` cell, the constructor of `RadioValueCoder`
(`RadioValueCoder.new`) is provided to `cell()` in the `coder`
argument.

If a cell's value is not restored, its value is recomputed. As a
result, it is not necessary that a cell's state be saved if it can be
recomputed.

Example:

<CodeGroup title="Recomputing Cell State">
```dart
class CellRestorationExample extends RestorableCellWidget {
  @override
  String get restorationId => 'cell_restoration_example';

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final numValue = cell(() => MutableCell<num>(1));
    final numMaybe = cell(() => numValue.maybe(), restorable: false);
    final numError = cell(() => numMaybe.error);

	final numStr = cell(() => numMaybe.mutableString());

    return Column(
      children: [
        const Text('Text field for numeric input:'),
		StaticWidget.builder((_) => CellTextField(
          content: numStr,
          decoration: ValueCell.computed(() => InputDecoration(
            errorText: numError() != null
               ? 'Not a valid number'
               : null
          )),
        )),
        const SizedBox(height: 10),
        CellWidget.builder((context) {
          final a1 = context.cell(() => numValue + 1.cell);
          return Text('${numValue()} + 1 = ${a1()}');
        }),
        ElevatedButton(
          child: const Text('Reset'),
          onPressed: () => numValue.value = 1
        )
      ],
    );
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

The above is an example of a text field for numeric input with error
handling. The only cells in the above example which have their state
restored are `numValue`, the cell holding the numeric value that was
entered in the field, and `numMaybe.mutableString()` which is the
*content* cell for the text field. When the state of the app is
restored the values of the remaining cells are recomputed, which
in-effect restores their state without it actually being saved.

When you leave the app and return to it, you'll see the exact same
state, including erroneous input and the associated error message, as
when you left.

Some points to note from this example:

* We've used `restorable: false`, in the `cell()` call for `numMaybe`
  to prevent its state from being saved, since `Maybe` values cannot
  be saved.
* If `restorable` is omitted (`null`) the cell's state is saved only
  if it is a `RestorableCell`. If `restorable` is `true` the cell's
  state is saved and an assertion is violated if the given cell is not
  a `RestorableCell`.
* Computed cells don't require their state to be saved, e.g. the state
  of the `a1` cell is not saved, since it is defined within a
  `CellWidget` rather than a `RestorableCellWidget`, however it is
  *restored* (the same state is recomputed on launch) nevertheless.

As a general rule of thumb only mutable cells which are either set
directly, such as `numValue` which has its value set in the "Reset"
button, or hold user input from widgets, such as the content cells of
text fields, are required to have their state saved.
