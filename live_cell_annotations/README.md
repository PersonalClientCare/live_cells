This package provides the definitions of the annotations for use with the 
[live_cells](https://pub.dev/packages/live_cells) and 
[live_cell_extension](https://pub.dev/packages/live_cell_extension). Check the documentation of
the respective packages for more information.

In general there is no need to depend on this package directly, as the
[live_cells](https://pub.dev/packages/live_cells) package already exports the annotations defined
in this package. Visit the documentation of the package for more information.
